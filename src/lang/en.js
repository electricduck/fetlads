            When I'm not groping someone in gear, imposing harsh pain on a willing voluneer, or laying down with my legs in the air, you'll find me crafting awesome things in whatever programming language takes my fancy, or taking photos of anything and everything.

            When I'm not face down on a bed making noises, tied/chained/taped to a fixed object, or cleaing someone's motocross boots with my tounge, you'll usually find me under the bonnet of a car, or tapping away on the nearest keyboard making shit happen.

To us, sexual energy is the most important thing in our relationship: how good we can make it gauges how happy we'll both be. Having first met on IRC — of all places — we quickly began to realise all the kinks we had in common, and since meeting, that list has only grown (and will continue to grow). Our top kinks are gear, bondage, pup-play, pain, and outdoors.",
